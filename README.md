# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the source code for my **personal portfolio website**, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries, just clean, hand-crafted code.

This site is a central hub for showcasing my projects, experiences, and career journey. It’s lightweight, responsive, and continuously evolving — with a blog section that will be updated soon.
