# Portfolio_Website
This is my portfolio website where I would link my projects and upload my experiences. I plan to build some of my web based projects into this website, so look out for these changes!
My contact information is also provided, so you can reach me if necessary.

P.S: The portfolio website needed to expand and has been moved off Github pages and is now hosted at the-jola-amodu.vercel.app .

As usual, look out for new developments!
